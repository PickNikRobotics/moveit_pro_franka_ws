# mobile_fr3_duo_mock

MoveIt Pro configuration for the Franka Mobile FR3 Duo: a TMR v0.2 swerve base, a vertical spine, two FR3 v2 arms and two Franka Hands.

This configuration runs on mock hardware (`mock_components/GenericSystem`), with no physics simulation and no driver. Nav2 drives the base on a map of a room (`maps/room.yaml`).

## Frames

`world` -> `map` (fixed) -> `odom` -> planar joints (`planar_x`, `planar_y`, `planar_theta`) -> `base_link`.

The URDF starts at `odom`. `launch/navigation.launch.py` publishes `world` -> `map` and `map` -> `odom` as fixed identities, because mock hardware has no localization and no drift. The planar joints are the base pose in `odom`, and `script/joint_state_odometry.py` publishes them as `/odom` for Nav2.

## Navigation

`launch/navigation.launch.py` starts the map server and Nav2 with `params/nav2_params.yaml`: the room map only (no laser on mock hardware) and a fixed `map` -> `odom`. Nav2's `/cmd_vel` goes through `script/base_twist_to_planar.py`, which turns it into world-axis planar joint velocities for `base_jgvc`.

Every navigation Objective first runs the subtree **"Stow Arms for Navigation"** (`objectives/stow_arms_for_navigation.xml`). It moves both arms, and the spine to its lowest height, to the `Stow` waypoint. Then the base drives. The Nav2 footprint in `params/nav2_params.yaml` covers the robot in that pose, so plans keep the stowed arms clear of obstacles.

| Objective | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| "Navigate to Clicked Point" | prompts for a point in the Visualization pane, stows the arms, then drives there |
| "Move Base to Ready" | stows the arms, then drives to the map origin |
| "Stow Arms for Navigation" | the shared stow step; a child configuration calls it before its own navigation |

`mobile_fr3_duo_sim` reuses this launch file. It adds AMCL and its laser obstacle layers through `params_overlay`: mappings merge and lists replace.

## Base teleoperation

The base is holonomic (a swerve drive), so it can move sideways. The `mobile_base` planning group holds only the planar joints, and the teleop jogs it like an arm: joint jog through `base_jvc` and pose jog of `base_link` through `base_vfc` (`config/moveit/joint_jog.yaml`, `pose_jog.yaml`). All base controllers command velocity, so a jog takes the base from `base_jgvc`, and the navigation Objectives give it back.

## Spine

The spine joint (`franka_spine_vertical_joint`, group `spine`) moves through:

- joint jog in the teleop, through `spine_jvc`;
- "Move Spine Absolute": an absolute height in meters, within the travel;
- "Move Spine to Pose Height": the height of a target pose, plus an optional bias, clamped to the travel.

Both Objectives run `spine_jtc` and leave the arms where they are. Their ports follow the real spine's `MoveAbsolute` action (position, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, timeout, action name), so callers stay the same on real hardware. Mock and sim ignore everything but the position. Real hardware has no ros2_control interface for the spine: it will need its own versions of these Objectives, with a Behavior that calls Franka's spine `MoveAbsolute` action. That is not part of this workspace yet.

The Behaviors `CreateSpineState` and `GetSpineStateForPoseHeight` come from `franka_behaviors`.

## Requirements

The robot description comes from the `franka_description` submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

## Build and run

```bash
moveit_pro build
moveit_pro run -c mobile_fr3_duo_mock
```

## Controllers

The whole upper body (`manipulator`: spine and both arms) keeps the standard controller name. Controllers for a part of the robot use short names: `jtac` (JointTrajectoryAdmittanceController), `jtc` (JointTrajectoryController), `vfc` (VelocityForceController), `jvc` (JointVelocityController), `jgvc` (JointGroupVelocityController). `left_`/`right_` is one arm; the `_w_spine` suffix adds the spine.

| `joint_state_broadcaster` | `joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster` | all joints | active |
