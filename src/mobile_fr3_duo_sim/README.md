# mobile_fr3_duo_sim

MoveIt Pro MuJoCo simulation configuration for the Franka Mobile FR3 Duo, with front and rear lidars, an IMU and base cameras.

The scene is a 12 m by 12 m room with a narrow passage, obstacles, a table and two scene cameras. The table stands within the arms' reach in front of the robot and is not in MoveIt's planning scene, so plan arm motions that keep clear of it. Nav2 runs on a map of that room (`maps/room.yaml`, made with slam_toolbox), and the "Navigate to Clicked Point" Objective drives the base there.

It inherits everything from `mobile_fr3_duo_mock` (robot description, SRDF, MoveIt parameters, Objectives and waypoints) and replaces the hardware, the controllers, the Behavior loaders (to add the Nav2 Behaviors) and the "Move Base to Ready" Objective.

## Frames and odometry

`world` -> `map` (fixed) -> `odom` (AMCL) -> planar joints -> `base_link`, the same chain as `mobile_fr3_duo_mock`; `world` -> `mj_world` anchors the simulator's own frames.

- The simulator publishes the true base pose only as a message, `/ground_truth/odom` in frame `mj_world`.
- `script/odometry_joint_state_publisher.py` is the only publisher of the planar joints and of `/odom`: it adds drift that grows with distance driven and angle turned, so AMCL has a real correction to make. Drift is on by default. For exact odometry, set the `odometry_drift` launch argument in `launch/additional_driver_nodes.launch.py` to `false`; it sets the bridge's `noise_enabled` parameter.
- `joint_state_broadcaster` lists every joint except the planar ones (`config/control/`), so the true planar values never reach `/joint_states`.
- `script/base_twist_to_planar.py` turns Nav2's `/cmd_vel` into planar joint velocities for `base_jgvc`, using the true heading.

This package has no base trajectory controller. With drift on, a planned base trajectory would land off by the drift accumulated so far: MoveIt plans it in the drifted `odom` frame, and the controller drives the true joints. So the base moves through Nav2 (`base_jgvc`, active at startup; AMCL corrects `map` -> `odom`) and through teleop on the `mobile_base` group: joint jog (`base_jvc`) and pose jog of `base_link` (`base_vfc`). The jog controllers read the simulator's true planar joints, so a pose jog in `base_link` moves the base along its true body axes. "Move Base to Ready" drives to the map origin with Nav2 here, replacing the mock's trajectory version. `mobile_fr3_duo_mock`, which has no drift, keeps `base_jtc`.

## MuJoCo xacro arguments

A child configuration can override these through `urdf_params`; the defaults are this package's values.

| Argument | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `mujoco_model` | `mjcf/scene.xml` |
| `mujoco_model_package` | `mobile_fr3_duo_sim` |
| `mujoco_keyframe` | `default` |
| `mujoco_viewer` | `false` |
| `publish_object_tf` | `true` |
| `ground_truth_odom_topic` | `/ground_truth/odom` |
| `ground_truth_odom_frame` | `mj_world` |
| `base_link_name` | `base_link` |

## Build and run

```bash
git lfs pull
git submodule update --init
moveit_pro build
moveit_pro run -c mobile_fr3_duo_sim
```

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `config/config.yaml` | inheritance from `mobile_fr3_duo_mock`, MuJoCo hardware parameters, Nav2 Behaviors |
| `config/control/` | ros2_control controllers for the simulation |
| `description/` | MuJoCo ros2_control hardware macro |
| `mjcf/` | MuJoCo scene and robot model |
| `mjcf/assets/` | meshes, and `robot_description.urdf`, the original conversion input for the MuJoCo model; it predates the `odom` root, is not loaded at run time, and must not be used to regenerate the MJCF until you re-root it at `odom` |
| `launch/`, `script/` | frames, lidar flattening, scan merging, the odometry bridge, the `cmd_vel` bridge, Nav2 bring-up |
| `test/` | tests for the odometry and `cmd_vel` bridges |
| `maps/`, `params/` | room map, Nav2 and slam_toolbox parameters |
| `objectives/` | Navigate to Clicked Point, Move Base to Ready |
