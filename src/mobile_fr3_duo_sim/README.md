# mobile_fr3_duo_sim

MoveIt Pro MuJoCo simulation configuration for the Franka Mobile FR3 Duo, with front and rear lidars, an IMU and base cameras.

The scene is a 12 m by 12 m room with a narrow passage, obstacles, a table and two scene cameras. Nav2 runs on a map of that room (`maps/room.yaml`, made with slam_toolbox), and the "Navigate to Clicked Point" Objective drives the base there.

It inherits everything from `mobile_fr3_duo_mock` (robot description, SRDF, MoveIt parameters, Objectives and waypoints) and replaces only the hardware and the controllers.

## Frames and odometry

`world` -> `map` (fixed) -> `odom` (AMCL) -> planar joints -> `base_link`, the same chain as `mobile_fr3_duo_mock`; `world` -> `mj_world` anchors the simulator's own frames.

- The simulator publishes the true base pose only as a message, `/ground_truth/odom` in frame `mj_world`.
- `script/odometry_joint_state_publisher.py` is the only publisher of the planar joints and of `/odom`: it adds drift that grows with distance driven and angle turned, so AMCL has a real correction to make. Drift is on by default. For exact odometry, set the `odometry_drift` launch argument in `launch/additional_driver_nodes.launch.py` to `false`; it sets the bridge's `noise_enabled` parameter.
- `joint_state_broadcaster` lists every joint except the planar ones (`config/control/`), so the true planar values never reach `/joint_states`.
- `script/base_twist_to_planar.py` turns Nav2's `/cmd_vel` into planar joint velocities for `base_jgvc`, using the true heading.

With drift on, base trajectory moves through `base_jtc` land off by the drift accumulated so far: MoveIt plans them in the drifted `odom` frame, and the controller drives the true joints. Nav2 moves do not, because AMCL corrects `map` -> `odom`.

## MuJoCo xacro arguments

A child configuration can override these through `urdf_params`; the defaults are this package's values.

| `mujoco_viewer` | `false` |
| `publish_object_tf` | `true` |
| `ground_truth_odom_topic` | `/ground_truth/odom` |
| `ground_truth_odom_frame` | `mj_world` |
| `base_link_name` | `base_link` |
