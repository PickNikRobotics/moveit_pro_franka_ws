"""Turns each MuJoCo 3D-lidar point cloud into the LaserScan the rest of the stack expects.

Both simulated SICK TIM571s are <camera> sensors with DEPTH_TYPE=THREE_D_LIDAR, so
picknik_mujoco_ros publishes them as an organized PointCloud2 rather than as a LaserScan.
Everything downstream of /scan_front and /scan_rear -- the two laser_filters chains, then
dual_laser_merger, then beluga_amcl on /scan_merged and both Nav2 costmap obstacle layers
on the filtered scans -- is built on LaserScan, and neither AMCL nor slam_toolbox accepts a
cloud at all. Flattening here keeps every one of those topics identical in name, type,
frame and angular window to what the <rangefinder> path published, so nothing else in the
package has to know which sensor model produced the scan. In particular
params/laser_filter_params.yaml keys its two self-hit rejection arcs off angle_min=0 and
angle_max=4.7124 in the lidar_*_ROS frame, and those still hold.

The cloud is `resolution` beams wide and 3 rows tall. Row 1 is the elevation-0 row and is
the only one that belongs in a 2D scan; rows 0 and 2 sit at +/-fovy/2 and would put floor
and ceiling returns into the scan plane. Columns run from azimuth -fov_x/2 to +fov_x/2
about the camera's optical Z, which is clockwise in the scan frame, so they are reversed to
give the counter-clockwise LaserScan convention.

Column order and the scan frame are fixed by the MJCF and are checked in against it: for
the front unit, column 810 lands at -135 deg and column 0 at +135 deg in the mount frame,
so after the reversal beam 0 sits at -135 deg, which is exactly where lidar_front_ROS puts
its X axis. If the camera or optical-site quaternions in description/ur5e_ridgeback.xml
change, these change with them.
